### Anecdotes App

Super basic app using Redux built whilst doing the fullstackopen course.

Originally written for part 6 in which is used a simple json served using the `json-server` package, this version is part of part 11.

Part 11 is about creating CI/CD pipelines/workflows using Github Actions. Since this originally did not use a proper DB, I have decided to also implement a proper backend using MongoDB for a challenge. Once that is up and running, I will create the pipeline for CI/CD.

Wish me luck!
